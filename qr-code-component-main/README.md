### What I learned

Learned how to position using grid

```html
<h1>The way i used the div to center the element</h1>
```
```css
*,
*::after,
*::before{
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    box-sizing: border-box;
}
:root{
    --White: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    --Light-gray: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
    --Grayish-blue: hsl(220, 15%, 55%);
    --Dark-blue: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
}
```


### Continued development

I want to focus more on grid and positioning items
